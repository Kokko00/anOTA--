## How it works

The circuit works by converting the input signal to a common mode compensation signal (VCMP) which is then added to the external inputs through a summing network. The summing network consists of a series of inverters which sum the VCMP signal with the input signal.

## How to test

To test the circuit, you would need to:
Apply a DC input signal to the circuit and measure the DC output voltage.
Apply an AC input signal to the circuit and measure the AC output voltage.
Measure the DC gain and the bandwidth of the circuit.
Measure the slew rate of the circuit.
Measure the input-referred noise of the circuit.
